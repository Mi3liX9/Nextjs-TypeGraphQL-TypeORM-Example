# Apollo Client v3 and Type-GraphQL in Next.js

I toke the example Leigh Halliday made in [his video](https://youtu.be/y34ym0-KZ8A) and add Type-GraphQL instead of Nexus.
# Nextjs-TypeGraphQL-TypeORM-Example

This example built with the above libraries to make building full-stack web-apps easier with graphql. 
Thanks to Leigh Halliday for mading [this video](https://youtu.be/y34ym0-KZ8A) because this example built on it. üòÅ
